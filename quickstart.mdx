This guide will walk you through the process of setting up your DeepMyst account and making your first API call.

## 1. Create Your DeepMyst Account

Before using DeepMyst, you'll need to sign up for an account:

1. Visit [deepmyst.com](https://deepmyst.com) to create your account
2. Enter your email address and create a secure password
3. Verify your email address by clicking the link sent to your inbox
4. Complete your account setup by providing your organization details

## 2. Connect Your Model Providers

DeepMyst works with your existing model provider accounts. You'll need to connect at least one provider to get started:

1. Navigate to the "Model Keys" section in the sidebar
2. Click on "Add Provider"
3. Select a provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Groq, etc.)
4. Enter your API key for that provider
5. Click "Save" to securely store your key
6. Repeat for any additional providers you want to use

> **Note**: DeepMyst securely encrypts and stores your provider API keys. These keys are only used to process requests through your existing model provider accounts.

## 3. Generate Your DeepMyst API Key

You'll need a DeepMyst API key to authenticate your requests:

1. In the DeepMyst dashboard, navigate to the "API Keys" section
2. Click on "Generate New API Key"
3. Enter a descriptive name for your key (e.g., "Development", "Production")
4. Select the appropriate access level
5. Copy the generated key and store it securely

> **Important**: Your DeepMyst API key is different from your provider keys. The DeepMyst key authenticates you to the DeepMyst service, while your provider keys allow DeepMyst to make calls to various AI models on your behalf.

## 4. Make Your First API Call

Once your account is set up, provider keys are added, and you've generated your DeepMyst API key, you can start making API calls. DeepMyst offers an OpenAI-compatible API, so you can use your existing code with minimal changes.

### Using Python

```python
# Using the official OpenAI Python library
from openai import OpenAI

# Just change the base URL and API key - keep your code the same!
client = OpenAI(
    api_key="your-deepmyst-api-key",  # Your DeepMyst API key from Step 3
    base_url="https://api.deepmyst.com/v1"  # DeepMyst endpoint
)

# Use the client exactly as you would with OpenAI
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",  # Use any supported model
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Explain quantum computing in simple terms"}
    ]
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

### Using JavaScript/TypeScript

```javascript
import OpenAI from 'openai';

// Configure the OpenAI client to use DeepMyst
const openai = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: 'your-deepmyst-api-key',  // Your DeepMyst API key
  baseURL: 'https://api.deepmyst.com/v1'  // DeepMyst endpoint
});

async function getCompletion() {
  const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: 'gpt-4o-mini',
    messages: [
      { role: 'user', content: 'Explain quantum computing in simple terms' }
    ]
  });

  console.log(completion.choices[0].message.content);
}

getCompletion();
```

### Using cURL

```bash
curl https://api.deepmyst.com/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-deepmyst-api-key" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Explain quantum computing in simple terms"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

## 5. Verify Your Integration

To confirm that your DeepMyst integration is working correctly:

1. Check the response from your API call to ensure it contains the expected content
2. Visit the "Usage" section in your DeepMyst dashboard to see your recent API calls
3. Verify that the request appears in your usage logs with the correct model and token count

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during setup or making API calls:

- **Authentication errors**: Verify that your DeepMyst API key is correct and being passed properly in the Authorization header
- **Provider connection issues**: Check that your provider API keys are valid and have sufficient quota
- **Model not found errors**: Ensure you're using a supported model name
- **Rate limiting**: Check your current usage and plan limits in the dashboard
