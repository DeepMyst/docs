description: "Improve LLM responses with advanced reasoning techniques"

DeepMyst's enhanced reasoning capabilities enable LLMs to solve complex problems more effectively by applying structured thinking approaches to their response generation process.

## Understanding Enhanced Reasoning

Traditional LLM responses sometimes lack the careful step-by-step reasoning needed for complex problems. DeepMyst addresses this by implementing various reasoning frameworks that guide models through more structured thought processes, resulting in more accurate, logical, and comprehensive responses.

## Available Reasoning Techniques

DeepMyst supports multiple reasoning techniques, each optimized for different types of tasks:

### Chain-of-Thought (COT)

The default reasoning technique that guides the model to break down problems into sequential steps:

```python
# Using Chain-of-Thought reasoning (default)
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini-reason",  # The -reason flag enables COT by default
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "If Sarah has 5 apples and gives 2 to Tom, then buys 3 more and gives half of her apples to Lisa, how many apples does Sarah have left?"}
    ]
)
```

### Tree-of-Thought (TOT)

Explores multiple reasoning paths simultaneously and selects the most promising one:

```python
# Using Tree-of-Thought reasoning
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini-reason-TOT",  # Specify TOT reasoning
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Find the most efficient algorithm for sorting a nearly-sorted array."}
    ]
)
```

### Graph-of-Thought (GOT)

Creates a network of interconnected concepts to solve problems with many related components:

```python
# Using Graph-of-Thought reasoning
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="claude-3-opus-reason-GOT",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Analyze how changes in interest rates affect different sectors of the economy."}
    ]
)
```

### Self-Consistency (SC)

Generates multiple independent solutions and identifies the most consistent answer:

```python
# Using Self-Consistency reasoning
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-reason-SC",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Solve this probability problem: In a class of 30 students, what's the probability that at least two students share the same birthday?"}
    ]
)
```

### Iterative Hierarchy-of-Thought (IHoT)

Tackles problems by breaking them into hierarchical sub-problems:

```python
# Using Iterative Hierarchy-of-Thought reasoning
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-reason-IHoT",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Design a comprehensive system architecture for an e-commerce platform."}
    ]
)
```

### Recursive Thinking (RT)

Applies repeated reasoning steps to increasingly refined versions of a problem:

```python
# Using Recursive Thinking reasoning
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="claude-3-haiku-reason-RT",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Write a recursive algorithm to find all permutations of a string."}
    ]
)
```

### Goal-Action-Trace (GAT)

Sets clear goals, defines actions to achieve them, and traces progress:

```python
# Using Goal-Action-Trace reasoning
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gemini-1.5-pro-reason-GAT",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Plan a marketing strategy for a new sustainable fashion brand."}
    ]
)
```

### Reinforced Logic Reasoning (RLR)

Emphasizes logical validity and consistency in each step:

```python
# Using Reinforced Logic Reasoning
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-reason-RLR",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Evaluate this logical argument: All men are mortal. Socrates is a man. Therefore, Socrates is mortal."}
    ]
)
```

### Hybrid Graph-Numerical Thinking (HGNT)

Combines graphical representation with numerical precision:

```python
# Using Hybrid Graph-Numerical Thinking
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="claude-3-opus-reason-HGNT",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Analyze this network flow problem with capacity constraints on each edge."}
    ]
)
```

## Choosing the Right Reasoning Technique

Different reasoning techniques excel at different types of problems:

| Reasoning Technique | Best For | Example Task |
|---------------------|----------|--------------|
| Chain-of-Thought (COT) | General problem-solving, step-by-step reasoning | Math word problems, logical puzzles |
| Tree-of-Thought (TOT) | Problems with multiple potential approaches | Complex coding tasks, strategic planning |
| Graph-of-Thought (GOT) | Interconnected concepts, relational reasoning | System analysis, causal relationships |
| Self-Consistency (SC) | Probabilistic problems, verification | Math proofs, probability questions |
| Iterative Hierarchy-of-Thought (IHoT) | Complex systems, hierarchical structures | Software architecture, organization design |
| Recursive Thinking (RT) | Nested problems, pattern recognition | Recursive algorithms, fractal analysis |
| Goal-Action-Trace (GAT) | Planning, procedural tasks | Project planning, strategy development |
| Reinforced Logic Reasoning (RLR) | Formal logic, argument analysis | Logical fallacies, philosophical arguments |
| Hybrid Graph-Numerical Thinking (HGNT) | Quantitative problems with graphical elements | Network analysis, flow problems |

If you're unsure which technique to use, DeepMyst can automatically select the most appropriate one:

```python
# Let DeepMyst select the best reasoning technique
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-reason-auto",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "What's the most efficient way to find the kth smallest element in an unsorted array?"}
    ]
)
```

## Combining with Other DeepMyst Features

Enhanced reasoning can be combined with other DeepMyst features for even better results:

```python
# Combine reasoning with token optimization
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-reason-optimize",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Explain quantum computing principles and their applications in cryptography."}
    ]
)
```

### With Automatic Model Selection

```python
# Use reasoning with the optimal model
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="DeepMyst-auto-reason",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Design an algorithm to efficiently find duplicate files across a network."}
    ]
)
```

### With Specific Techniques and Priorities

```python
# Use Tree-of-Thought reasoning with optimal model, prioritizing performance
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="DeepMyst-auto-performance-reason-TOT",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "What's the optimal strategy for the prisoner's dilemma when played repeatedly?"}
    ]
)
```

3. **Use auto-selection**: When in doubt, let DeepMyst choose the best reasoning approach
4. **Balance with optimization**: Consider token usage impacts when using reasoning techniques
5. **Review reasoning steps**: Analyze the model's thought process to identify and correct flaws

## Real-World Applications

Enhanced reasoning is particularly valuable for:
