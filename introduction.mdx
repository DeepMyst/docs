## Getting Started

Integrate DeepMyst into your workflow in minutes with our API-compatible gateway.

### Installation

```bash
# Coming soon: DeepMyst CLI
npm install -g deepmyst-cli
```

### Basic Usage

DeepMyst supports standard LLM API formats with special flags that unlock advanced capabilities.

```python
import requests

response = requests.post(
    "https://api.deepmyst.ai/v1/chat/completions",
    headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {YOUR_API_KEY}"},
    json={
        "model": "gpt-4o-mini",  # Use any supported model
        "messages": [
            {"role": "user", "content": "Explain quantum computing"}
        ]
    }
)

print(response.json())
```

## Advanced Capabilities

DeepMyst extends standard LLM functionality with powerful flags that transform how your AI interacts with users.

### Token Optimization

Add the `-optimize` flag to any model name to automatically reduce token usage while preserving content quality:

```python
# Standard request with token optimization
response = requests.post(
    "https://api.deepmyst.ai/v1/chat/completions",
    headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {YOUR_API_KEY}"},
    json={
        "model": "gpt-4o-mini-optimize",  # Note the -optimize flag
        "messages": [
            {"role": "user", "content": "Explain the history of artificial intelligence"}
        ]
    }
)
```

### Enhanced Reasoning

Apply advanced reasoning techniques to improve the LLM's problem-solving capabilities:

```python
# Use Chain-of-Thought (default)
response = requests.post(
    "https://api.deepmyst.ai/v1/chat/completions",
    headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {YOUR_API_KEY}"},
    json={
        "model": "gpt-4o-mini-reason",  # Default reasoning mode (COT)
        "messages": [
            {"role": "user", "content": "Solve this logic puzzle: If all blues are greens and no yellows are greens, then..."}
        ]
    }
)

# Specify a reasoning technique
response = requests.post(
    "https://api.deepmyst.ai/v1/chat/completions",
    headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {YOUR_API_KEY}"},
    json={
        "model": "gpt-4o-mini-reason-TOT",  # Use Tree-of-Thought reasoning
        "messages": [
            {"role": "user", "content": "What's the most efficient algorithm for this problem?"}
        ]
    }
)
```

### Automatic Model Selection

Let DeepMyst choose the best model for your query:

```python
response = requests.post(
    "https://api.deepmyst.ai/v1/chat/completions",
    headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {YOUR_API_KEY}"},
    json={
        "model": "DeepMyst-auto",  # Automatic model selection
        "messages": [
            {"role": "user", "content": "Create a Python function to analyze sales data"}
        ]
    }
)
```

## Supported Models
