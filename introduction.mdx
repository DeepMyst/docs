## Getting Started

### 1. Sign Up for DeepMyst

Before using DeepMyst, you'll need to sign up for an account:

1. Visit [app.deepmyst.ai](https://app.deepmyst.ai) to create your account
2. Go through the onboarding wizard or navigate to the "Model Keys" section in the sidebar
3. Add your existing API keys for each model provider you want to use (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Groq, etc.)

<img src="/images/model-keys-page.png" alt="DeepMyst Model Keys Page" />

> **Note**: DeepMyst securely stores your provider API keys and uses them to process requests. This allows DeepMyst to route and optimize queries through your existing model provider accounts.

### 2. Use Your DeepMyst API Key

Once your account is set up and provider keys are added, integrate DeepMyst into your workflow with our OpenAI-compatible API gateway. **No new libraries needed** - just use your existing OpenAI SDK!

```python
# Using the official OpenAI Python library
from openai import OpenAI

# Just change the base URL and API key - keep your code the same!
client = OpenAI(
    api_key="your-deepmyst-api-key",  # Your DeepMyst API key from the dashboard
    base_url="https://api.deepmyst.ai/v1"  # DeepMyst endpoint
)

# Use the client exactly as you would with OpenAI
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",  # Use any supported model
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Explain quantum computing"}
    ]
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

## Advanced Capabilities

DeepMyst extends standard LLM functionality with powerful flags that transform how your AI interacts with users.

### Token Optimization

Add the `-optimize` flag to any model name to automatically reduce token usage while preserving content quality:

```python
# Using the OpenAI client with token optimization
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    api_key="your-deepmyst-api-key",
    base_url="https://api.deepmyst.ai/v1"
)

# Just add -optimize to the model name
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini-optimize",  # Note the -optimize flag
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Explain the history of artificial intelligence"}
    ]
)
```

### Enhanced Reasoning

Apply advanced reasoning techniques to improve the LLM's problem-solving capabilities:

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    api_key="your-deepmyst-api-key",
    base_url="https://api.deepmyst.ai/v1"
)

# Use Chain-of-Thought (default reasoning technique)
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini-reason",  # Default reasoning mode (COT)
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Solve this logic puzzle: If all blues are greens and no yellows are greens, then..."}
    ]
)

# Specify a different reasoning technique
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini-reason-TOT",  # Use Tree-of-Thought reasoning
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "What's the most efficient algorithm for this problem?"}
    ]
)
```

### Automatic Model Selection

Let DeepMyst choose the best model for your query:

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    api_key="your-deepmyst-api-key",
    base_url="https://api.deepmyst.ai/v1"
)

# Let DeepMyst automatically select the best model
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="DeepMyst-auto",  # Automatic model selection
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Create a Python function to analyze sales data"}
    ]
)
```

## Supported Models
